# Reading Notes Project

I created this project when I was in high school and learning programming. I love reading books, but sometimes I must take a break. After a break, I couldn't remember where I was in the book and what was happening. So, this project helps me remember where I am in the book.

## How It Works

1. **Add Book Details:** Start the program from the console, enter the book's name, and jot down your notes.
2. **Automatic Note Storage:** The program creates a dedicated text file for each book you add.
3. **Easy Access:** Access your notes anytime by opening the respective text file.
4. **Update and Delete:** You can update your notes or delete the file if you've finished the book.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the program from the console.
3. Enter the book's name and take your notes.
4. Retrieve your notes from the generated text file.
